Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews and Twitter Airline Sentiments

Perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset and the Twitter Airline Sentiment Dataset using machine learning models. Categorize text data as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Getting Started:

Follow these steps to run the sentiment analysis code for both datasets:

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- wordcloud (for Twitter dataset)

You can install them using the following command:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn wordcloud

Running the Code:

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd sentiment-analysis

3. Place the provided datasets (IMDB.csv and Tweets.csv) in the project directory.

4. Open and run the imdb_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook for the IMDb dataset or twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook for the Twitter dataset using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

5. Follow the notebook's instructions to perform sentiment analysis on the respective dataset.

Results and Observations:

The notebook will display classification metrics and observations about model performance. Gain insights into sentiment distribution and model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
