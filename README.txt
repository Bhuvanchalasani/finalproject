Sentiment Analysis on Movie Reviews, Twitter Airline Sentiments, and News Group Dataset

Perform sentiment analysis on the IMDb movie reviews dataset, the Twitter Airline Sentiment Dataset, and the news group dataset using various machine learning models. Categorize text data as positive, negative, or neutral sentiments.

Getting Started:

Follow these steps to run the sentiment analysis code for all datasets using different algorithms:

Prerequisites:

Ensure you have the required Python libraries installed:
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- wordcloud (for Twitter dataset)

You can install them using the following command:

pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn wordcloud

Running the Code:

1. Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/sentiment-analysis.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd sentiment-analysis

3. Place the provided datasets (IMDB.csv and Tweets.csv) in the project directory.

4. Open and run the imdb_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook for the IMDb dataset or twitter_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook for the Twitter dataset using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

5. For the news group dataset, open and run the news_group_sentiment_analysis.ipynb notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab.

6. In the notebooks, explore different machine learning models including Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Gradient Descent for sentiment analysis.

Results and Observations:

The notebooks will display classification metrics and observations about model performance for each dataset. Gain insights into sentiment distribution and model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score using different algorithms.

Future Extensions:

This section is a placeholder for future extensions, suggesting how the project could be further improved or expanded.
